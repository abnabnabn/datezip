# Bolt Performance Journal

This is the performance journal of Bolt, where critical learnings and performance wins/metrics are documented.

## 2026-08-04 - Batching file metadata lookups in execute_status
**Learning:** Sequential file status queries in loops are extremely slow in Bash. Batching paths via `xargs stat` and doing lookups in an O(N) `awk` associative array delivers a huge speedup (>170x). To avoid crashing/unsupported function issues in BSD `awk` (such as One True Awk on macOS), `strftime` should not be used in `awk`. Instead, pre-format date/time via BSD `stat` formatting flags or parse the default GNU `stat` format in `awk` via string slicing. For BSD `stat`, use `%n` instead of `%N` to prevent symlink dereference decoration issues.
**Action:** Detect GNU vs BSD `stat` dynamically in Bash, run `xargs stat` with `--` to protect against parameter injection, and process the results in `awk` safely. Symmetrically strip `./` from paths to avoid matching discrepancies.

## 2026-09-18 - Eliminating subshell process forks in backup iteration loops
**Learning:** Glob expansion of `datezip_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_*.zip` in Bash already returns filenames in sorted lexicographical (and thus chronological) order. Piping arrays through subshell loops `< <(printf ... | sort)` or spawning external processes (`basename`, `cut`, `ls`, `grep`) inside loops creates substantial process fork overhead that degrades CLI responsiveness when handling large backup sets.
**Action:** Use native Bash glob sorting directly (`local sorted=("$BACKUP_DIR_NAME"/datezip_*.zip)`) and pure parameter expansion (`${f##*/}`, `${f#...}`, `${f%...}`) instead of subshell utilities inside loops.

## 2026-10-24 - Single-pass stream processing for history filtering and formatting
**Learning:** Reading history log files line-by-line in Bash `while read` loops with temporary disk file allocations (`mktemp`) and repeated disk file existence checks (`[[ -f ... ]]`) creates high process fork overhead and disk I/O bottlenecks. Extracting FULL backup timestamps upfront via Bash globbing and piping history directly into `sort -r` and a single POSIX `awk` process yields a >10x speedup (~0.44s vs ~4.58s for 50k history lines).
**Action:** Pass filter criteria and pre-extracted FULL timestamps to AWK, avoiding temporary disk files and `length(array)` (which fails on BSD AWK), and buffer matched records in POSIX-compliant AWK arrays.
