# Sentinel Security Journal

This is the journal of Sentinel, where critical security learnings specific to the codebase are documented.

## 2026-07-20 - [Shell Arithmetic Evaluation and Command Injection in retention/restoration flags]
**Vulnerability:** Shell arithmetic injection via `--keep-full` and `--keep-days` options, and missing input validation on `--restore-index`, `--restore-time`, and `--restore-type`. Unsanitized user inputs could lead to arbitrary command execution when evaluated inside bash double-parentheses constructs `$(( ... ))` or comparison/conditional constructs.
**Learning:** Bash's arithmetic expansion `$(( expression ))` evaluates parameter and string values inside the expression dynamically, meaning index references like `arr[$(command)]` or expression formats are evaluated as subshells/commands. This can allow command execution even if the variable containing the string is not directly executed in a standard command.
**Prevention:** Always strictly validate all user-supplied numeric arguments and string parameters using regex matches (e.g., `[[ ! "$VAR" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]`) at argument parsing time before allowing them to be utilized anywhere in the script, particularly in arithmetic expansions or command evaluations.
## 2026-07-21 - [Option/Argument Injection and Regex Injection in File Operations]
**Vulnerability:** Option/argument injection via user-supplied paths/files starting with a hyphen, and potential regex injection inside loop lookup logic in `execute_status`.
**Learning:** Utilities like `mkdir`, `cp`, `ln`, `chmod`, and `rm` can have their option-parsing hijacked if target file paths or directories start with a hyphen (`-`). Similarly, using `grep` with unescaped variable input interprets regex control characters inside filenames, leading to incorrect matches.
**Prevention:** Explicitly validate user-supplied paths and files to ensure they do not start with a hyphen (`-`) and append `--` to separate options from positional arguments in system utility calls. For status file matching, use exact hash lookups (via `awk`) rather than sequential regex grep.

## 2026-07-22 - [Option Injection via Multi-Value Parameter Lists]
**Vulnerability:** Option injection in `unzip` calls when multi-value parameter lists like `--files` contain comma-separated entries where a non-initial entry starts with a hyphen (e.g. `--files "file1.txt,-option"`).
**Learning:** Checking parameter strings for leading hyphens only at the string level (`[[ "$VAR" =~ ^- ]]`) fails when the parameter is a delimiter-separated list. Subsequent elements in the split array inherit the hyphen and are interpreted as options by commands like `unzip` that lack standard `--` delimiter support.
**Prevention:** When validating multi-value parameter lists, split the input string on delimiters (e.g., `IFS=',' read -ra ...`) and validate each individual item for leading hyphens before accepting the parameter.
